### üö® Breaking Changes & Migration Guide

#### 1. Intervention Image Update (2.x ‚Üí 3.x)

**Impact**: Complete API change, requires PHP 8.1+

**Before (v2.x)**:
```php
use Intervention\Image\ImageManagerStatic as Image;
Image::make($path)->resize(300, 200)->save();
```

**After (v3.x)**:
```php
use Intervention\Image\ImageManager;
use Intervention\Image\Drivers\Gd\Driver;

$manager = new ImageManager(new Driver());
$image = $manager->read($path);
$image->resize(300, 200)->save();
```

**Action Required**:
- Upgrade to PHP 8.1+ (if not already done)
- Run `composer update` to get Intervention Image 3.x
- LiteImage core handles the API changes automatically
- No action needed if you only use `liteimage()` function

#### 2. PHP Version Requirement (5.6 ‚Üí 8.1)

**Impact**: Sites running PHP 5.6-8.0

**Action Required**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL**: Upgrade your server to PHP 8.1 or higher

- PHP 7.4-8.0 are no longer supported by this version

#### 3. Log File Location

**Impact**: If you're manually accessing log files

**Before**: `wp-content/plugins/liteimage/logs/`
**After**: `wp-content/uploads/liteimage-logs/`

**Action Required**:
- Update any scripts or monitoring tools that access log files
- Old logs are NOT automatically migrated (safe to delete old logs directory)
